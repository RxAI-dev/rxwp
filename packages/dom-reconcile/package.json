  "description": "The world's most advanced DOM reconcile algorithm that's optimizing the number of DOM updates - could be even more than 2x faster than classic LIS/LCS based algorithm, that are optimized for array iterations, that are far less expensive than real DOM updates. Sequential Three-Way Splice algorithm is optimized of DOM updates - doing even 2x less DOM updates for complex reconcile cases. It has also all the advanced fast path optimizations, to handle reconciliation with O(N) efficiency",
